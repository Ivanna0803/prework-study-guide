# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide Project was created by Bootcamp Front-End student, as a part of the Prework. The process of creating this webpage allowed me to learn about the basic fundamentals and ideas of Web Development, and webpage became a field where i can note and keep track of all the things I am learning in the bootcamp. As a result, we can find here some notes about HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.
